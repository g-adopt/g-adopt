# Compressible (ALA) 2-D mantle convection problem in a square box
# ================================================================
#
# Our previous tutorial, which examined convection under the Truncated Anelastic Liquid
# Approximation (TALA), can be easily modified to use an Anelastic Liquic Approximation (ALA),
# as we demonstrate here.
#
# This example
# ------------
#
# We simulate compressible convection, for an isoviscous material,
# under ALA. We specify $Ra=10^5$ and a dissipation number $Di=0.5$.
# The model is heated from below $ T = 1.0 - (T0*\mbox{exp}(Di) - T0)$, cooled from the top (T=0)
# in an enclosed 2-D Cartesian box (i.e. free-slip mechanical boundary
# conditions on all boundaries).
#
# Key differences relative to our previous tutorial, which examined convection under the TALA
# approximation, are:
# 1. We no longer neglect the effect of dynamic pressure on buoyancy.
# 2. Specificiation of nullspaces for Stokes system, as this example has a non-constant
#    pressure nullspace (vertical, decreasing with depth).
#
# As with all examples, the first step is to import the gadopt module, which
# provides access to Firedrake and associated functionality.

from gadopt import *

# We next set up the mesh, function spaces, and specify functions to hold our solutions,
# identically to our previous tutorials.

nx, ny = 40, 40  # Number of cells in x and y directions.
mesh = UnitSquareMesh(nx, ny, quadrilateral=True)  # Square mesh generated via firedrake
mesh.cartesian = True
boundary = get_boundary_ids(mesh)  # Boundary IDs

V = VectorFunctionSpace(mesh, "CG", 2)  # Velocity function space (vector)
W = FunctionSpace(mesh, "CG", 1)  # Pressure function space (scalar)
Q = FunctionSpace(mesh, "CG", 2)  # Temperature function space (scalar)
Z = MixedFunctionSpace([V, W])  # Mixed function space.

z = Function(Z)  # A field over the mixed function space Z.
u, p = split(z)  # Returns symbolic UFL expression for u and p
z.subfunctions[0].rename("Velocity")
z.subfunctions[1].rename("Pressure")
# -

# We next specify the important constants for this problem, including those associated with the
# compressible reference state. Note that for ease of extension, we specify these as functions,
# allowing for spatial variability. Given that we account for the effect of dynamic pressure on
# buoyancy in this example, we need to specify the bulk modulus (`chibar`), which differs to the TALA case.

X = SpatialCoordinate(mesh)
Ra = Constant(1e5)  # Rayleigh number
Di = Constant(0.5)  # Dissipation number

Tbar = Function(Q, name="CompRefTemperature").interpolate(T0 * exp((1.0 - X[1]) * Di) - T0)  # Reference temperature

# These fields are used to set up our Anelastic Liquid Approximation. Alongside adding the
# requirement for specifying the bulk modulus, this is the key change relative to our tutorial under the TALA approximation.

approximation = AnelasticLiquidApproximation(Ra, Di, rho=rhobar, Tbar=Tbar)

# As with the previous examples, we next set up a *Timestep Adaptor*,
# for controlling the time-step length (via a CFL
# criterion) as the simulation advances in time. For the latter,
# we specify the initial time, initial timestep $\Delta t$, and number of
# timesteps. Given the low Ra, a steady-state tolerance is also specified,
# allowing the simulation to exit when a steady-state has been achieved.
# The steady-state tolerance specified here is tight, and can be increased
# to speed up the simulation, as required.

t_adapt = TimestepAdaptor(delta_t, u, V, maximum_timestep=0.1, increase_tolerance=1.5)
steady_state_tolerance = 1e-9  # Used to determine if solution has reached a steady state.

# We next set up and initialise our Temperature field. Note that here, we take into consideration
# the non-dimensional surface temperature, T0. The full temperature field is also initialised.

T = Function(Q, name="Temperature")

# As noted above, this problem has a non-constant pressure nullspace (vertical, decreasing with depth)
# for the right nullspace, and a constant nullspace for the transpose (left) nullspace.
# We obtain the right nullspace (`Z_nullspace`) by providing the approximation object and subdomain marker
# for the top boundary (where the pressure nullspace is referenced â€” see the
# [nullspace visualisation](../visualise_ALA_p_nullspace) demo for more details). The left nullspace (`Z_nullspace_transpose`) is
# handled identically to the previous [TALA](../2d_compressible_TALA) tutorial.
