# 2D mantle convection in square box with Druker-Prager rheology
# ==============================================================
#
# In this tutorial we consider a case from [Spiegelman et al.
# (2016)](https://doi.org/10.1002/2015GC006228) with a Drucker-Prager
# visco-plasticity model that depends on dynamic pressure. As this leads to
# nonlinear systems that can be quite challenging to solve, we use this case to
# illustrate some of the strategies involved.
#
# Similar to the [visco-plastic tutorial](viscoplastic_case.md) which uses a
# temperature and depth dependent von Mises rheology, the overall effective
# viscosity takes the following form
#
#
# $$\mu(\dot \epsilon, p, d) = \left(\frac{1}{\mu_1} +
# \frac{1}{\mu_{\text{plast}}(\dot\epsilon, p, d)} \right)^{-1}, $$
#
# where $\mu_1$ represents a constant linear background viscosity (not
# temperature dependent in this case) and $\mu_{\text{plast}}$ is the plastic
# viscosity which depends on strain rate $\dot\epsilon$, dynamic pressure $p$
# and depth $d$:
#
# $$\mu_{\text{plast}}(\dot \epsilon, p, d) = \frac{A +
# B\left(p_{\text{lith}}(d) + p\right)}{2\dot\epsilon}, $$
#
# with a depth-dependent lithostatic pressure:
#
# $$p_{\text{lith}}(d) = \rho_0 g d $$
#
#
# We start by setting a number of constants that are defined in [Spiegelman et
# al. (2016)](https://doi.org/10.1002/2015GC006228), where we use velocity
# $U_0$, depth $H$ and viscosity $\mu_0$ to non-dimensionalise the equations.

# the interface depth is $H_1-h$ over a width of $w$. In the description of

# We also need to define the lithostatic pressure using the formula above, but

# to get the non-dimensional lithostatic pressure.

# We now have everything to define the viscosity. We do this in a particular
# way that will come in hand later on:
# * we introduce a switch which, when its value is 1, produces the
# Drucker-Prager viscosity as described above. However, if we assign a value of
# 0 to the switch, the viscosity changes to isoviscous with value `mu1`
# * we use a python function to supply the second invariant of the strain rate
# epsii and dynamic pressure p. This is because we will later on need a version
# of the viscosity defined using different Firedrake Functions than we have
# defined here.

# As usual we now define an approximation and boundary conditions and set up

# (the default), and free slip ${\bf u}\cdot{\bf n}=0$ at the bottom. The left
# and right boundaries both have a prescribed Dirichlet inflow condition of
# ${\bf u}\cdot{\bf n}=-U_0$, or ${\bf u}\cdot{\bf n}=-1$ in non-dimensional
# units. In terms of the x-component of velocity this means a value of 1 and -1
# respectively for the left and right boundaries.

# Picard Solver
# -------------
# Instead of using Newton's algorithm to solve the nonlinear system, we try a
# so called Picard iteration approach. This means that we linearize the system
# based on our understanding of the physics. For the Stokes system we fix a
# best guess (or value from the previous iteration) $u_{\text{Picard}}$ and
# $p_{\text{Picard}}$ for velocity and pressure, and solve
#
# $$ -\nabla\cdot \mu\left(u_{\text{Picard}}, p_{\text{Picard}}\right)
# \left[\nabla u + \nabla u^T\right] + \nabla p = 0 $$
#
# for a new u and p. Note that we're now effectively dealing with a _linear_
# viscosity which does not depend on the $u$ and $p$ we are solving for. We now
# solve this linear system in an iterative loop, in each iteration substituting
# $u_{\text{Picard}}$ and $p_{\text{Picard}}$ with the value of $u$ and $p$ we
# solved in the previous iteration. Assuming the values of $u$ and $p$ converge
# between iterations - this is not guaranteed! - and thus $u_{\text{Picard}}\to
# u$ and $p_{\text{Picard}}\to p$, we converge to the original nonlinear system
# we wanted to solve. It is therefore important to monitor how close the values
# of $u$ and $p$ get between iterations.
#
# To construct this Picard solver, we simply define another solver but now
# using a viscosity that depends on `u_picard` and `p_picard` that we will
# update between iterations.

    z,  # note we're still solving into the same u,p as before
    approximation_picard,
    bcs=bcs
)
# -

# There is still one problem, we do not have a very good "best guess" for
# `u_picard` and `p_picard` in the first iteration. In fact, if we start with a
# zero velocity (as we usually do), the second invariant is also zero, and you
# can see in the formulae above that we are dividing by zero. As a workaround,
# we first do a separate iteration in which we simply replace the viscosity by
# the constant background value `mu1`. As we saw above, we can do this by
# assigning a value of 0 to the switch - without needing to redefine the solver
# again.

switch.assign(0.)  # switch to mu=mu1
picard_solver.solve()

# So far so we good, but now only we have solution $(u, p$) for the wrong
# rheology (namely $\mu=\mu_1$). To solve the equations with the actual
# Drucker-Prager rheology, we put the switch back to 1.0, and perform the
# Picard iteration. The assignment at the start of the iteration, copies the
# values of $u$ and $p$, that we have just solved, into $u_{\text{Picard}}$ and
# $p_{\text{Picard}}$ to be used in the viscosity in this iteration. We
# calculate how much the values of $u$ and $p$ change between iterations and
# decide when to quit.

switch.assign(1.)  # switch back to Drucker-Prager
for i in range(50):
    z_picard.assign(z)

    u_change, p_change = norm(u-u_picard), norm(p-p_picard)
    print(f"In iteration {i}, L2 norm difference in u, and p between iterations:", u_change, p_change)
    if u_change < 1e-5 and p_change < 1e-5:
        break


# As you can see, it takes a fair number of iterations before the changes in
# $u$ and $p$ get sufficiently small. Note that the residuals ("SNES Function
# norm") that are being printed are the residuals of the linearized equations.
# Only when the differences between $(u,p)$ and $(u_{\text{Picard}},
# p_{\text{Picard}})$ are sufficiently small does this mean that we have solved
# the nonlinear Drucker-Prager equations.
#
# In fact we can check this by using the Newton solver. Since our best solution
# is now stored in `u` and `p`, when we call the Newton solver this will be
# used as the initial guess for the full nonlinear Newton solve. The residuals
# that are now printed are the residuals of the actual nonlinear equations we
# wanted to solve.

newton_solver = StokesSolver(
    z,
    approximation,
    bcs=bcs,
)
newton_solver.solve()

# We see that the initial residual in the Newton solve is now already down to `9e-6`, and the Newton solver is now able to reduce it even further down to `2e-13`. This is as expected: the convergence of the Picard iteration is more robust, but slower. When we have a sufficiently good initial guess, the Newton solver converges much faster. A common strategy for challenging cases is therefore to start with a few Picard iterations, followed by a Newton solve, as summarized in the following code:

# +
z.assign(0)  # throw away our solution and start from 0 again

switch.assign(0.)  # switch to mu=mu1
picard_solver.solve()
switch.assign(1.)  # switch back to full rheology
for i in range(10):
    z_picard.assign(z)
    picard_solver.solve()

newton_solver.solve()

# Finally, let us visualise the solution

# For testing purposes we also write some statistics to a `param.log` file:

plog.log_str(f"{gd.u_rms()} {gd.ux_max()}")
plog.close()

# Exercise
# --------
# The case above still has a relatively small viscosity contrast between the
# two layers. We can make this case more challenging by increasing $\mu_1$.
# Increasing the inflow velocity $U_0$, also make the equations harder to
# solve.  Look up table 2 from [Spiegelman et al.
# (2016)](https://doi.org/10.1002/2015GC006228) for some suggestions.
#
# Newton Stabilisation
# --------------------
# As also briefly discussed in [Davies et al.
# (2022)](https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-5127-2022) G-ADOPT paper, for the most
# challenging cases the convergence of the Newton solver is not necessarily
# stable, even with an initial guess from the Picard iteration. To stabilize
# it, the paper follows an approach from [Fraters et al.
# (2019)](https://doi.org/10.1093/gji/ggz183) to modify the Jacobian used in
# the Newton solve and demonstrates it can be implemented in a few lines of
# code in G-ADOPT. The code is available in one of the tests:
# `tests/Drucker-Prager_rheology/spiegelman.py` in the G-ADOPT repository.
