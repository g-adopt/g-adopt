# Idealised 2-D mantle convection problem inside an annulus
# =====================================================================
#
# In this tutorial, we analyse mantle flow in a 2-D annulus domain. We define our domain by the radii
# of the inner ($r_{\text{min}}$) and outer ($r_{\text{max}}$) boundaries. These are chosen such that
# the non-dimensional depth of the mantle, $z = r_{\text{max}} - r_{\text{min}} = 1$, and the ratio of
# the inner and outer radii, $f=r_{\text{min}} / r_{\text{max}} = 0.55$, thus approximating the ratio
# between the radii of Earth's surface and core-mantle-boundary (CMB). Specifically, we set
# $r_{\text{min}} = 1.22$ and $r_{\text{max}} = 2.22$.
#
# This example focusses on differences between running simulations in a 2-D annulus and 2-D Cartesian domain. These can be summarised as follows:
# 1. The geometry of the problem - i.e. the computational mesh.
# 2. The radial direction of gravity (as opposed to the vertical direction in a Cartesian domain).
# 3. Initialisation of the temperature field in a different domain.
# 4. With free-slip boundary conditions on both boundaries, this case incorporates a (rotational) velocity nullspace, as well as a pressure nullspace.
#
# The example is configured at $Ra = 1e5$. Boundary conditions are free-slip at the surface and base of the domain.

#
# The first step is to import the gadopt module, which
# provides access to Firedrake and associated functionality.
# We also import pyvista, which is used for plotting vtk output.

# We next set up the mesh, function spaces, and specify functions to hold our solutions,
# as with our previous tutorials.
#
# We generate a circular manifold mesh (with 128 elements) and extrude in the radial direction,
# using the optional keyword argument `extrusion_type`, forming 32 layers. To better represent the
# curvature of the domain and ensure accuracy of our quadratic representation of velocity, we
# approximate the curved cylindrical shell domain quadratically, using the optional keyword argument `degree`$=2$.
# Because this problem is not formulated in a Cartesian geometry, we set the `mesh.cartesian`
# attribute to False. This ensures the correct configuration of a radially inward vertical direction.

# We next specify the important constants for this problem, and set up the approximation.

Ra = Constant(1e5)  # Rayleigh number
approximation = BoussinesqApproximation(Ra)

# As with the previous examples, we set up a *Timestep Adaptor*,
# for controlling the time-step length (via a CFL
# criterion) as the simulation advances in time. For the latter,
# we specify the initial time, initial timestep $\Delta t$, and number of
# timesteps. Given the low Rayleigh number, a steady-state tolerance is also specified,
# allowing the simulation to exit when a steady-state has been achieved.

time = 0.0  # Initial time
delta_t = Constant(1e-7)  # Initial time-step

t_adapt = TimestepAdaptor(delta_t, u, V, maximum_timestep=0.1, increase_tolerance=1.5)
steady_state_tolerance = 1e-7  # Used to determine if solution has reached a steady state.

# We next set up and initialise our Temperature field.
# We choose the initial temperature distribution to trigger upwelling of 4 equidistant plumes.
# This initial temperature field is prescribed as:
#
# $$T(x,y) = (r_{\text{max}} - r) + A\cos(4 \; atan2\ (y,x))  \sin(r-r_{\text{min}}) \pi)$$
#
# where $A=0.02$ is the amplitude of the initial perturbation.

T = Function(Q, name="Temperature")
r = sqrt(X[0]**2 + X[1]**2)
T.interpolate(rmax - r + 0.02*cos(4*atan2(X[1], X[0])) * sin((r - rmin) * pi))

# As noted above, with a free-slip boundary condition on both boundaries, one can add an arbitrary rotation
# of the form $(-y, x)=r\hat{\mathbf{\theta}}$ to the velocity solution (i.e. this case incorporates a velocity nullspace,
# as well as a pressure nullspace). These lead to null-modes (eigenvectors) for the linear system, rendering the resulting matrix singular.
# In preconditioned Krylov methods these null-modes must be subtracted from the approximate solution at every iteration. We do that below,
# setting up a nullspace object as we did in the previous tutorial, albeit speciying the `rotational` keyword argument to be True.
# This removes the requirement for a user to configure these options, further simplifying the task of setting up a (valid) geodynamical simulation.

# Given the increased computational expense (typically requiring more degrees of freedom) in a 2-D annulus domain, G-ADOPT defaults to iterative
# solver parameters. As noted in our previous 3-D Cartesian tutorial, G-ADOPT's iterative solver setup is configured to use the GAMG preconditioner
# for the velocity block of the Stokes system, to which we must provide near-nullspace information, which, in 2-D, consists of two rotational and two
# translational modes.

# Boundary conditions are next specified. Boundary conditions for temperature are set to $T = 0$ at the surface ($r_{\text{max}}$) and $T = 1$
# at the base ($r_{\text{min}}$). For velocity, we specify free‚Äêslip conditions on both boundaries. We incorporate these <b>weakly</b> through
# the <i>Nitsche</i> approximation. This illustrates a key advantage of the G-ADOPT framework: the user only specifies that the normal component
# of velocity is zero and all required changes are handled under the hood.
