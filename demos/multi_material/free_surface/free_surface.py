# Spontaneous subduction
# ======================

# This example
# ------------

# Here, we consider the spontaneous subduction benchmark presented in [Schmeling et al.
# (2008)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pepi.2008.06.028).
# Inside a 2-D domain, a lithosphere sinks into the upper mantle under its own negative
# buoyancy. Here we consider the scenario where the top boundary is modelled as a free
# surface. We describe below how to implement this problem using G-ADOPT.

# As with all examples, the first step is to import the `gadopt` package, which
# provides access to Firedrake and associated functionality.

from gadopt import *

# We next set up the mesh and function spaces and specify functions to hold our
# solutions, as in our previous tutorials.

# +
nx, ny = 256, 64  # Number of cells in x and y directions
lx, ly = 3e6, 7e5  # Domain dimensions in x and y directions
# Rectangle mesh generated via Firedrake
mesh = RectangleMesh(nx, ny, lx, ly, quadrilateral=True)
mesh.cartesian = True  # Tag the mesh as Cartesian to inform other G-ADOPT objects.
left_id, right_id, bottom_id, top_id = 1, 2, 3, 4  # Boundary IDs

V = VectorFunctionSpace(mesh, "Q", 2)  # Velocity function space (vector)
W = FunctionSpace(mesh, "Q", 1)  # Pressure function space (scalar)
Z = MixedFunctionSpace([V, W, W])  # Stokes function space (mixed)
K = FunctionSpace(mesh, "DQ", 2)  # Level-set function space (scalar, discontinuous)
R = FunctionSpace(mesh, "R", 0)  # Real space (constants across the domain)

z = Function(Z)  # A field over the mixed function space Z
u, p, eta = split(z)  # Indexed expressions for velocity, pressure, and free surface
z.subfunctions[0].rename("Velocity")  # Associated Firedrake function for velocity
z.subfunctions[1].rename("Pressure")  # Associated Firedrake function for pressure
z.subfunctions[2].rename("Free surface")  # Associated Firedrake function for surface
psi = Function(K, name="Level set")  # Firedrake function for level set

# We now initialise the level-set field. All we have to provide to G-ADOPT is a
# mathematical description of the interface location and use the available API. In this
# case, the interface can be represented as a polygon, requiring vertex coordinates to
# be provided. Under the hood, G-ADOPT uses the `Shapely` library to determine the
# signed-distance function associated with the interface. We use G-ADOPT's default
# strategy to obtain a smooth step function profile from the signed-distance function.

# Initialise the level-set field. First, determine the signed-distance function at each
# level-set node using a mathematical description of the material-interface location.
# Then, define the thickness of the hyperbolic tangent profile used in the conservative
# level-set approach. Finally, overwrite level-set data array.

# Let us visualise the location of the material interface that we have just initialised.
# To this end, we use Firedrake's built-in plotting functionality.

# We next define the material fields and instantiate the approximation. Here, the system
# of equations is non-dimensional and only includes compositional buoyancy under the
# Boussinesq approximation. Moreover, physical parameters are constant through space
# apart from density. As a result, the system is fully defined by the compositional
# Rayleigh number. We use the `material_field` function to define its value throughout
# the domain (including the shape of the material interface transition) and provide it
# to our approximation.

# Here, we set up the variational problem for the Stokes and level-set systems. The
# former depends on the approximation defined above, and the latter includes both
# advection and reinitialisation components. Subcycling is available for level-set
# advection and is mainly useful when the problem at hand involves multiple CFL
# conditions, with the CFL for level-set advection being the most restrictive.
# Boundary conditions are specified next: a free surface at the top and free slip at all
# other boundaries. No boundary conditions are required for level set, as the numerical
# domain is closed.
