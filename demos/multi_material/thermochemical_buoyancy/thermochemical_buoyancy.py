# Thermochemical convection
# ---

# Rationale
# -

# Our previous tutorial introduced multi-material simulations in G-ADOPT by
# investigating compositional effects on buoyancy. We extend that tutorial to include
# thermal effects, thereby simulating thermochemical convection, which is, for example,
# essential to modelling Earth's mantle evolution.

# This example
# -

# Here, we consider the entrainment of a thin, compositionally dense layer by thermal
# convection presented in [van Keken et al. (1997)](https://doi.org/10.1029/97JB01353).
# Inside a 2-D domain heated from below, a denser material sits at the bottom boundary
# beneath a lighter material. Whilst the compositional stratification is stable, heat
# transfer from the boundary generates positive buoyancy in the denser material,
# allowing thin tendrils to be entrained in the convective circulation. To resolve these
# tendrils using the level-set approach, significant mesh refinement is needed, making
# the simulation computationally expensive. This tutorial will be updated once the
# development of adaptive mesh refinement in Firedrake is complete. We describe below
# the current implementation of this problem in G-ADOPT.

# As with all examples, the first step is to import the `gadopt` package, which also
# provides access to Firedrake and associated functionality.

from gadopt import *

# For this problem, it is useful to define a mesh with non-uniform refinement. To this
# end, we use the GMSH library to generate a mesh file in a format compatible with
# Firedrake. We specifically increase vertical resolution at the top and bottom
# boundaries of the domain.
