# # Rayleigh-Taylor instability
# ---

# Rationale
# -

# One may wish to simulate a geodynamical flow involving multiple physical phases. A
# possible approach is to approximate phases as immiscible, forming a single fluid that
# still behaves as a single-phase Stokes flow. Under this approximation, it is usual to
# refer to immiscible phases as materials and the resulting simulations as
# multi-material. In such simulations, each material occupies part of the numerical
# domain and has intrinsic physical properties, such as density and viscosity. Across a
# material interface, physical properties transition from one value to another, either
# sharply or smoothly. In the former case, physical property fields exhibit
# discontinuities, whilst in the latter case, an averaging scheme weights contributions
# from each material.

# Numerical approach
# -

# We employ an interface-capturing approach called the conservative level-set method
# ([Olsson and Kreiss, 2005](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2005.04.007)) to model the
# coexistence of multiple materials in the numerical domain. Level-set methods associate
# each material interface to a mathematical field measuring the distance from that
# interface. In the conservative level-set approach, the classic signed-distance
# function, $\phi$, employed in the level-set method is transformed into a smooth step
# function, $\psi$:

# $$\psi(\mathbf{x}, t) = \frac{1}{2} \left[
# \mathrm{tanh} \left( \frac{\phi(\mathbf{x}, t)}{2\epsilon} \right) + 1
# \right]$$

# Throughout the simulation, the level-set field is advected with the flow:

# $$\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot \left( \mathbf{u}\psi \right) = 0$$

# Advection of the level set modifies the shape of the initial profile. In other words,
# the signed-distance property underpinning the smooth step function is lost. To
# maintain the original profile whilst the simulation proceeds, a reinitialisation
# procedure is employed. We choose the equation proposed in [Parameswaran and Mandal
# (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.euromechflu.2022.11.001):

# $$\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial \tau_{n}} = \theta \left[
# -\psi \left( 1 - \psi \right) \left( 1 - 2\psi \right)
# + \epsilon \left( 1 - 2\psi \right) \lvert\nabla\psi\rvert
# \right]$$

# This example

# Here, we consider the isoviscous Rayleigh-Taylor instability presented in [van Keken
# et al. (1997)](https://doi.org/10.1029/97JB01353). Inside a 2-D domain, a buoyant,
# lighter material sits beneath a denser material. The initial material interface
# promotes the development of a rising instability on the domain's left-hand side, and
# further convective dynamics occur throughout the remainder of the simulation. We
# describe below the implementation of this problem using G-ADOPT.

# As with all examples, the first step is to import the `gadopt` package, which also
# provides access to Firedrake and associated functionality.

from gadopt import *

# We next set up the mesh and function spaces and specify functions to hold our
# solutions, as in our previous tutorials.

nx, ny = 64, 64  # Number of cells in x and y directions
lx, ly = 0.9142, 1  # Domain dimensions in x and y directions
# Rectangle mesh generated via Firedrake
mesh = RectangleMesh(nx, ny, lx, ly, quadrilateral=True)
mesh.cartesian = True  # Tag the mesh as Cartesian to inform other G-ADOPT objects
boundary = get_boundary_ids(mesh)  # Object holding references to mesh boundary IDs

V = VectorFunctionSpace(mesh, "Q", 2)  # Velocity function space (vector)
W = FunctionSpace(mesh, "Q", 1)  # Pressure function space (scalar)
Z = MixedFunctionSpace([V, W])  # Stokes function space (mixed)
Q = FunctionSpace(mesh, "Q", 2)  # Temperature function space (scalar)
K = FunctionSpace(mesh, "DQ", 2)  # Level-set function space (scalar, discontinuous)
R = FunctionSpace(mesh, "R", 0)  # Real space (constants across the domain)

z = Function(Z)  # A field over the mixed function space Z
u, p = split(z)  # Indexed expressions for velocity and pressure
z.subfunctions[0].rename("Velocity")  # Associated Firedrake function for velocity
z.subfunctions[1].rename("Pressure")  # Associated Firedrake function for pressure
T = Function(Q, name="Temperature")  # Firedrake function for temperature
psi = Function(K, name="Level set")  # Firedrake function for level set

# We now initialise the level-set field. All we have to provide to G-ADOPT is a
# mathematical description of the interface location and use the available API. In this
# case, the interface can be represented as a cosine, requiring a callable to be
# provided. Under the hood, G-ADOPT uses the `Shapely` library to determine the
# signed-distance function associated with the interface. We use G-ADOPT's default
# strategy to obtain a smooth step function profile from the signed-distance function.

# Initialise the level-set field. First, determine the signed-distance function at each
# level-set node using a mathematical description of the material-interface location.
# Then, define the thickness of the hyperbolic tangent profile used in the conservative
# level-set approach. Finally, overwrite level-set data array.

# We next define the material fields and instantiate the approximation. Here, the system
# of equations is non-dimensional and only includes compositional buoyancy under the
# Boussinesq approximation. Moreover, physical parameters are constant through space
# apart from density. As a result, the system is fully defined by the compositional
# Rayleigh number. We use the `material_field` function to define its value throughout
# the domain (including the shape of the material interface transition) and provide it
# to our approximation.

# As with the previous examples, we set up an instance of the `TimestepAdaptor` class
