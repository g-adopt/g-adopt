# Idealised 2-D mantle convection problem inside an annulus
# =====================================================================

# In this tutorial, we analyse mantle flow in a 2-D annulus domain. We define our domain by the radii
# of the inner ($r_{\text{min}}$) and outer ($r_{\text{max}}$) boundaries. These are chosen such that
# the non-dimensional depth of the mantle, $z = r_{\text{max}} - r_{\text{min}} = 1$, and the ratio of
# the inner and outer radii, $f=r_{\text{min}} / r_{\text{max}} = 0.55$, thus approximating the ratio
# between the radii of Earth's surface and core-mantle-boundary (CMB). Specifically, we set
# $r_{\text{min}} = 1.22$ and $r_{\text{max}} = 2.22$.

# This example focusses on differences between running simulations in a 2-D annulus and 2-D Cartesian domain. These can be summarised as follows:
# 1. The geometry of the problem - i.e. the computational mesh.
# 2. The radial direction of gravity (as opposed to the vertical direction in a Cartesian domain).
# 3. Initialisation of the temperature field in a different domain.
# 4. With free-slip boundary conditions on both boundaries, this case incorporates a (rotational) velocity nullspace, as well as a pressure nullspace.

# The example is configured at $Ra = 1e5$. Boundary conditions are free-slip at the surface and base of the domain.


# The first step is to import the gadopt module, which
# provides access to Firedrake and associated functionality.
# We also import pyvista, which is used for plotting vtk output.

# We next set up the mesh, function spaces, and specify functions to hold our solutions,
# as with our previous tutorials.

# We generate a circular manifold mesh (with 128 elements) and extrude in the radial direction,
# using the optional keyword argument `extrusion_type`, forming 32 layers. To better represent the
# curvature of the domain and ensure accuracy of our quadratic representation of velocity, we
# approximate the curved cylindrical shell domain quadratically, using the optional keyword argument `degree`$=2$.
# Because this problem is not formulated in a Cartesian geometry, we set the `mesh.cartesian`
# attribute to False. This ensures the correct configuration of a radially inward vertical direction.

# We now initialise the level-set field. All we have to provide to G-ADOPT is a

# signed-distance function associated with the interface. We use G-ADOPT's default
# strategy to obtain a smooth step function profile from the signed-distance function.

# Initialise the level-set field. First, determine the signed-distance function at each

# As with the previous examples, we set up a *Timestep Adaptor*,

# We next set up and initialise our Temperature field.

# As noted above, with a free-slip boundary condition on both boundaries, one can add an arbitrary rotation
# of the form $(-y, x)=r\hat{\mathbf{\theta}}$ to the velocity solution (i.e. this case incorporates a velocity nullspace,
# as well as a pressure nullspace). These lead to null-modes (eigenvectors) for the linear system, rendering the resulting matrix singular.
# In preconditioned Krylov methods these null-modes must be subtracted from the approximate solution at every iteration. We do that below,
# setting up a nullspace object as we did in the previous tutorial, albeit speciying the `rotational` keyword argument to be True.
# This removes the requirement for a user to configure these options, further simplifying the task of setting up a (valid) geodynamical simulation.

# the <i>Nitsche</i> approximation. This illustrates a key advantage of the G-ADOPT framework: the user only specifies that the normal component
# of velocity is zero and all required changes are handled under the hood.
