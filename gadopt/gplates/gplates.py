        using plate tectonic reconstructions.

        This class provides functionality to assign plate velocities at different geological
        ages to the boundary conditions specified with dbc. Due to potential challenges in
        identifying the plate id for a given point with pygplates, especially in high-resolution
        simulations, this interface employs a method of calculating velocities at a number
        of equidistant points on a sphere. It then interpolates these velocities for points
        assigned a plate id. A warning is raised for any point not assigned a plate id.

        Arguments:
            rotation_filenames (Union[str, List[str]]): Collection of rotation file names for pygplates.
            topology_filenames (Union[str, List[str]]): Collection of topology file names for pygplates.

            scaling_factor (Optional[float]): Scaling factor for surface velocities.
            nseeds (Optional[int]): Number of seed points used in the Fibonacci sphere generation. Higher
                    seed point numbers result in finer representation of boundaries in pygpaltes. Notice that
                    the finer velocity variations will then result in more challenging Stokes solves.

    def _fibonacci_sphere(self, samples):
        """Generates points on a sphere using the Fibonacci sphere algorithm, which
        distributes points approximately evenly over the surface of a sphere.

        This method calculates coordinates for each point using the golden angle,
        ensuring that each point is equidistant from its neighbors. The algorithm
        is particularly useful for creating evenly spaced points on a sphere's
        surface without clustering at the poles, a common issue in other spherical
        point distribution methods.

        Args:
            samples (int): The number of points to generate on the sphere's surface.

        Returns:
            numpy.ndarray: A 2D array of shape (samples, 3), where each row
                           contains the [x, y, z] coordinates of a point on the
                           sphere.

        Example:
            >>> sphere = _fibonacci_sphere(100)
            >>> print(sphere.shape)
            (100, 3)

        Note:
            We use this method for generating seed points that can be interpolated onto our mesh

        References:
            The algorithm is based on the concept of the golden angle, derived from
            the Fibonacci sequence and the golden ratio.
