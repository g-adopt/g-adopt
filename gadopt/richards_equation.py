r"""Richards equation terms for unsaturated flow.

This module implements the individual terms for the Richards equation for
variational unsaturated flow. The Richards equation describes movement of
the wetting phase in a two-phase flow system, if we ignore the
compressibility of the dry phase.

All terms are considered as if they were on the right-hand side of the equation, leading
to the following UFL expression returned by the `residual` method:

$$
  (dh)/dt = sum "term.residual()"
$$

This sign convention ensures compatibility with G-ADOPT's time integrators. In general,
however, we like to think about the terms as they are on the left-hand side. Therefore,
in the residual methods below, we first sum the terms in the variable `F` as if they
were on the left-hand side, i.e.

$$
  (dh)/dt + F(h) = 0,
$$

and then return `-F`.

The Richards equation in mixed form:

$$
  (S_s S + C) \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial t} + \\nabla \\cdot (K \\nabla h) + \\nabla \\cdot (K \\nabla z) = 0
$$

where:
- $h$ is the pressure head
- $S_s$ is the specific storage coefficient
- $S(h) = (\\theta - \\theta_r)/(\\theta_s - \\theta_r)$ is the effective saturation
- $C(h) = d\\theta/dh$ is the specific moisture capacity
- $K(h)$ is the hydraulic conductivity
- $z$ is the vertical coordinate (gravity term)
